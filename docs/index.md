# Kamaji Simulation Environment

Kamaji is a flexible and extensible multi-agent simulation environment designed for research and development in autonomous systems, control theory, and coordination strategies. It enables the modeling of large-scale, heterogeneous agent systems with support for custom dynamics, control architectures, and interaction mechanisms like auctions or barrier functions.

Kamaji is built for:

- Simulating realistic multi-agent behavior in 2D/3D space
- Testing control strategies like PID, CBF, geometric, or learned controllers
- Implementing and evaluating fairness-based coordination and resource allocation
- Running large simulations for urban air mobility (UAM), swarming, or multi-robot planning

## Features

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Each agent can be assigned custom dynamics, goals, and control models.
- **Controller Support**: Includes PID, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), and auction-based control allocation mechanisms.
- **Simulation Core**: A flexible time-stepped engine that supports integration with advanced control loops and interaction constraints.
- **Real-time GUI (WIP)**: PyQt-based interface for visualizing and interacting with simulations.
- **Logging & Analysis**: Integrated support for logging states and control inputs, with HDF5 export and analysis tools.
- **Extensible Models**: Easily add new dynamics, control types, or interaction rules.

Kamaji is inspired by the need for scalable, interpretable, and fair multi-agent coordination tools â€” and borrows its name from the many-armed boiler master in *Spirited Away*, who utilizes an army of sootballs to run a complex but beautifully organized machine.
